# BusTracker
BusTracker is an Android application that allows any users of public road transport, bus users, to know information about them and, in particular, their exact position.

Goals:

- Allow the user to have better access to bus information.
- Keep the user always up to date with possible deviations from the usual transport behavior.
- In general, facilitate the day-to-day of people using public road services.


BusTracker uses positioning devices, placed on local public transport network buses, which emit GPS coordinates. These coordinates are then used to show the bus positions on the application map.
With this the user has in his hand a tool that allows him to obtain information, for example:
- The position of the waiting bus
- If the bus has already passed a stop
- If the bus is late due to traffic jams
- Check if a bus comes from accessibility for people with mobility difficulties.
- Inform the user of a forecast of the estimated time for the arrival of the bus at the stop.
- See the exact location of the bus on the map
- See the bus route
- See where it took longer
- See estimated time and time on time
- Consult the characteristics of the buses
- Consult nearby stops
- Consult stop routes
- Record favorite stops
- Favorite routes
- Can see how much you will pay for ticket
- Notification when the bus is almost at the stop
